  abstract = "The cortical surface is organized into a large number of cortical
              areas; however, these areas have not been comprehensively mapped
              in the human. Abrupt transitions in resting-state functional
              connectivity (RSFC) patterns can noninvasively identify locations
              of putative borders between cortical areas (RSFC-boundary
              mapping; Cohen et al. 2008). Here we describe a technique for
              using RSFC-boundary maps to define parcels that represent
              putative cortical areas. These parcels had highly homogenous RSFC
              patterns, indicating that they contained one unique RSFC signal;
              furthermore, the parcels were much more homogenous than a null
              model matched for parcel size when tested in two separate
              datasets. Several alternative parcellation schemes were tested
              this way, and no other parcellation was as homogenous as or had
              as large a difference compared with its null model. The boundary
              map-derived parcellation contained parcels that overlapped with
              architectonic mapping of areas 17, 2, 3, and 4. These parcels had
              a network structure similar to the known network structure of the
              brain, and their connectivity patterns were reliable across
              individual subjects. These observations suggest that
              RSFC-boundary map-derived parcels provide information about the
              location and extent of human cortical areas. A parcellation

              used in visual ratings scales, how to best anatomically define
              the two classes is still disputed. In fact, the methods used to
              define PWMH and DWMH vary significantly between studies, making
              results difficult to compare. The purpose of this study was
              twofold: first, to compare four current criteria used to define
              PWMH and DWMH in a cohort of healthy older adults (mean age:
              69.58 $\pm$ 5.33 years) by quantifying possible differences in
              terms of estimated volumes; second, to explore associations
              between the two WMH sub-classes with cognition, tissue
              microstructure and cardiovascular risk factors, analysing the
              impact of different criteria on the specific associations. Our
              results suggest that the classification criterion used for the
              definition of PWMH and DWMH should not be considered a major
              obstacle for the comparison of different studies. We observed
              that higher PWMH load is associated with reduced cognitive
              function, higher mean arterial pressure and age. Higher DWMH load
              is associated with higher body mass index. PWMH have lower
              fractional anisotropy than DWMH, which also have more
              heterogeneous microstructure. These findings support the
              hypothesis that PWMH and DWMH are different entities and that
              their distinction can provide useful information about healthy

              exhibit high variability in their characteristics both at
              population- and subject-level, making their detection a
              challenging task. Population-level factors such as age, vascular
              risk factors and neurodegenerative diseases affect lesion load
              and spatial distribution. At the individual level, WMH vary in
              contrast, amount and distribution in different white matter
              regions. In this work, we aimed to improve BIANCA, the FSL tool
              for WMH segmentation, in order to better deal with these sources
              of variability. We worked on two stages of BIANCA by improving
              the lesion probability map estimation (classification stage) and
              making the lesion probability map thresholding stage automated
              and adaptive to local lesion probabilities. Firstly, in order to
              take into account the effect of population-level factors, we
              included population-level lesion probabilities, modelled with
              respect to a parametric factor (e.g. age), in the classification
              stage. Secondly, we tested BIANCA performance when using four
              alternative classifiers commonly used in the literature with
              respect to K-nearest neighbour algorithm (currently used for
              lesion probability map estimation in BIANCA). Finally, we propose
              LOCally Adaptive Threshold Estimation (LOCATE), a supervised
              method for determining optimal local thresholds to apply to the
              estimated lesion probability map, as an alternative option to
              global thresholding (i.e. applying the same threshold to the
              entire lesion probability map). For these experiments we used
              data from a neurodegenerative cohort, a vascular cohort and the
              cohorts available publicly as a part of a segmentation challenge.
              We observed that including population-level parametric lesion
              probabilities with respect to age and using alternative machine
              learning techniques provided negligible improvement. However,
              LOCATE provided a substantial improvement in the lesion
              segmentation performance, when compared to the global
              thresholding. It allowed to detect more deep lesions and provided
              better segmentation of periventricular lesion boundaries, despite
              the differences in the lesion spatial distribution and load
              across datasets. We further validated LOCATE on a cohort of
              CADASIL (Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with
              subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) patients, a genetic
              form of cerebral small vessel disease, and healthy controls,

              neurological disease present in the ageing population that is
              associated with an increased risk of dementia and stroke. Damage
              to white matter tracts compromises the substrate for
              interneuronal connectivity. Analysing resting-state functional
              magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can reveal dysfunctional
              patterns of brain connectivity and contribute to explaining the
              pathophysiology of clinical phenotypes in CSVD. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: This systematic review provides an overview of methods
              and results of recent resting-state functional MRI studies in
              patients with CSVD. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for
              Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol, a
              systematic search of the literature was performed. RESULTS: Of
              493 studies that were screened, 44 reports were identified that
              investigated resting-state fMRI connectivity in the context of
              cerebral small vessel disease. The risk of bias and heterogeneity
              of results were moderate to high. Patterns associated with CSVD
              included disturbed connectivity within and between intrinsic
              brain networks, in particular the default mode, dorsal attention,
              frontoparietal control, and salience networks; decoupling of
              neuronal activity along an anterior-posterior axis; and increases
              in functional connectivity in the early stage of the disease.
              CONCLUSION: The recent literature provides further evidence for a
              functional disconnection model of cognitive impairment in CSVD.
              We suggest that the salience network might play a hitherto
              underappreciated role in this model. Low quality of evidence and
              the lack of preregistered multi-centre studies remain challenges

              impairment that is easy to implement, reflects disease burden,
              and is strongly associated with processing speed, the
              predominantly affected cognitive domain in SVD. METHODS: We
              developed a novel magnetic resonance imaging marker based on
              diffusion tensor imaging, skeletonization of white matter tracts,
              and histogram analysis. The marker (peak width of skeletonized
              mean diffusivity [PSMD]) was assessed along with conventional SVD
              imaging markers. We first evaluated associations with processing
              speed in patients with genetically defined SVD (n = 113). Next,
              we validated our findings in independent samples of inherited SVD
              (n = 57), sporadic SVD (n = 444), and memory clinic patients with
              SVD (n = 105). The new marker was further applied to healthy
              controls (n = 241) and to patients with Alzheimer's disease (n =
              153). We further conducted a longitudinal analysis and
              interscanner reproducibility study. RESULTS: PSMD was associated
              with processing speed in all study samples with SVD (p-values
              between 2.8 $\times$ 10(-3) and 1.8 $\times$ 10(-10) ). PSMD
              explained most of the variance in processing speed (R(2) ranging
              from 8.8\% to 46\%) and consistently outperformed conventional
              imaging markers (white matter hyperintensity volume, lacune
              volume, and brain volume) in multiple regression analyses.
              Increases in PSMD were linked to vascular but not to
              neurodegenerative disease. In longitudinal analysis, PSMD
              captured SVD progression better than other imaging markers.
              INTERPRETATION: PSMD is a new, fully automated, and robust
              imaging marker for SVD. PSMD can easily be applied to large
              samples and may be of great utility for both research studies and

              sex, high-sensitive CRP, NT-proBNP, and commonly measured
              cardiovascular risk and systemic hemodynamic factors, both CP
              (B=0.15;CI:0.04, 0.26;p=0.006) and low PSV (B=-0.49;
              CI:-0.87,-0.11;p=0.012) were significantly associated with a
              higher tWMH and PSMD. Low PSV(B=-0.48;CI:-0.87,-0.1;p=0.013) was
              associated with pWMH, and presence of CP with pWMH (B=0.15;

              CONCLUSION: Low PSV and CP are associated with WMH and PSMD
              independent of cardiovascular risk factors and biomarkers of

              dementia (B = -2.35, odds ratio = 0.095, = 0.00056). Change in
              network global efficiency mediated much of the association of
              conventional MRI markers of SVD with cognitive decline and
              progression to dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Network disruption has a
              central role in the pathogenesis of cognitive decline and
              dementia in SVD. It may be a useful disease marker to identify
              that subgroup of patients with SVD who progress to dementia.",

              in specific cognitive domains in participants from the
              prospective, population-based Rotterdam Scan Study. Participants
              were 60-90 years of age and free from dementia at baseline in
              1995-1996. White matter lesions (WML), cerebral infarcts and
              generalized brain atrophy were assessed on the baseline MRI. We
              performed neuropsychological testing at baseline and repeatedly
              in 1999-2000 and in 2001-2003. We used random-effects models for
              repeated measures to examine the association between quantitative
              MRI measures and rate of decline in measures of global cognitive
              function, information processing speed, executive function and
              memory. There were a total of 2266 assessments for the 832
              participants in the study, with an average time from the initial
              to last assessment of 5.2 years. Increasing severity of
              periventricular WML and generalized brain atrophy and the
              presence of brain infarcts on MRI were associated with a steeper
              decline in cognitive function. These structural brain changes
              were specifically associated with decline in information
              processing speed and executive function. The associations between
              MRI measures of cerebral small-vessel disease and cognitive
              decline did not change after additional adjustment for vascular
              risk factors or depressed mood. After exclusion of participants

              with measures of information processing speed and executive
              function were no longer significant. This may indicate that
              stroke plays an intermediate role in the relationship between

              vessel disease (cSVD). Functional magnetic resonance imaging has
              highlighted connections between patterns of brain activity and
              variability in behavior. We aimed to characterize the
              associations between imaging markers of cSVD, dynamic
              connectivity, and cognitive impairment. METHODS: We obtained
              magnetic resonance imaging and clinical data from the
              population-based Hamburg City Health Study. cSVD was quantified
              by white matter hyperintensities and peak-width of skeletonized
              mean diffusivity (PSMD). Resting-state blood oxygen
              level-dependent signals were clustered into discrete brain
              states, for which fractional occupancies (\%) and dwell times
              (seconds) were computed. Cognition in multiple domains was
              assessed using validated tests. Regression analysis was used to
              quantify associations between white matter damage, spatial
              coactivation patterns, and cognitive function. RESULTS: Data were
              available for 979 participants (ages 45-74 years, median white
              matter hyperintensity volume 0.96 mL). Clustering identified five
              brain states with the most time spent in states characterized by
              activation (+) or suppression (-) of the default mode network
              (DMN) (fractional occupancy: DMN+ = 25.1 $\pm$ 7.2\%, DMN- = 25.5
              $\pm$ 7.2\%). Every 4.7-fold increase in white matter
              hyperintensity volume was associated with a 0.95-times reduction
              of the odds of occupying DMN+ or DMN-. Time spent in DMN-related
              brain states was associated with executive function. CONCLUSIONS:
              Associations between white matter damage, whole-brain spatial
              coactivation patterns, and cognition suggest equalization of time
              spent in different brain states as a marker for cSVD-associated
              cognitive decline. Reduced gradients between brain states in
              association with brain damage and cognitive impairment reflect
              the dedifferentiation hypothesis of neurocognitive aging in a

              age-related cognitive decline, but the mechanisms underlying this
              phenomenon remain incompletely understood. We hypothesized that
              vascular risk factors would lead to cognitive impairment through
              the disruption of brain white matter network efficiency. Methods-
              Participants were 19 346 neurologically healthy individuals from
              UK Biobank that underwent diffusion MRI and cognitive testing
              (mean age=62.6). Global efficiency, a measure of network
              integration, was calculated from white matter networks
              constructed using deterministic diffusion tractography. First, we
              determined whether demographics (age, sex, ethnicity,
              socioeconomic status, and education), vascular risk factors
              (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking,
              body mass index), and white matter hyperintensities were related
              to global efficiency using multivariate linear regression. Next,
              we used structural equation modeling to model a multiple
              regression. The dependent variable was a latent cognition
              variable using all cognitive data, while independent variables
              were a latent factor including all vascular risk factors
              (vascular burden), demographic variables, white matter
              hyperintensities, and global efficiency. Finally, we used
              mediation analysis to determine whether global efficiency
              explained the relationship between vascular burden and cognition.
              Results- Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were consistently
              associated with reduced global efficiency even after controlling
              for white matter hyperintensities. Structural equation models
              revealed that vascular burden was associated with cognition
              (=0.023), but not after adding global efficiency to the model
              (=0.09), suggesting a mediation effect. Mediation analysis
              revealed a significant indirect effect of global efficiency on
              cognition through vascular burden (<0.001), suggesting a partial
              mediation effect. Conclusions- Vascular burden is associated with
              reduced global efficiency and cognitive impairment in the general
              population. Network efficiency partially mediates the
              relationship between vascular burden and cognition. This suggests
              that treating specific risk factors may prevent reductions in
              brain network efficiency and preserve cognitive functioning in
              the aging population.",

              (CSVD) and explore the relationships between DFC temporal
              properties and cognitive impairment in CSVD. Methods: Functional
              data were collected from 67 CSVD patients, including 35 patients
              with subcortical vascular cognitive impairment (SVCI) and 32
              cognitively unimpaired (CU) patients, as well as 35 healthy
              controls (HCs). The DFC properties were estimated by kmeans
              clustering analysis. DFC strength analysis was used to explore
              the regional functional alterations between CSVD patients and
              HCs. Correlation analysis was used for DFC properties with
              cognition and SVD scores, respectively. Results: The DFC analysis
              showed three distinct connectivity states (state I: sparsely
              connected, state II: strongly connected, state III: intermediate
              pattern). Compared to HCs, CSVD patients exhibited an increased
              proportion in state I and decreased proportion in state II.
              Besides, CSVD patients dwelled longer in state I while dwelled
              shorter in state II. CSVD subgroup analyses showed that state I
              frequently occurred and dwelled longer in SVCI compared with
              CSVD-CU. Also, the internetwork (frontal-parietal lobe,
              frontal-occipital lobe) and intranetwork (frontal lobe, occipital
              lobe) functional activities were obviously decreased in CSVD.
              Furthermore, the fractional windows and mean dwell time (MDT) in
              state I were negatively correlated with cognition in CSVD but
              opposite to cognition in state II. Conclusion: Patients with CSVD
              accounted for a higher proportion and dwelled longer mean time in
              the sparsely connected state, while presented lower proportion
              and shorter mean dwell time in the strongly connected state,
              which was more prominent in SVCI. The changes in the DFC are
              associated with altered cognition in CSVD. This study provides a

              neurological conditions that confer a significant burden of

              recognized in its advanced stages once its symptomatic sequelae
              develop. However, its significance in asymptomatic healthy
              populations remains poorly defined. In population-based studies
              of presumed healthy elderly individuals, CSVD neuroimaging
              markers including white matter hyperintensities, lacunes,
              cerebral microbleeds, enlarged perivascular spaces, cortical

              ageing. Features seen on neuroimaging include recent small
              subcortical infarcts, lacunes, white matter hyperintensities,
              perivascular spaces, microbleeds, and brain atrophy. SVD can
              present as a stroke or cognitive decline, or can have few or no
              symptoms. SVD frequently coexists with neurodegenerative disease,
              and can exacerbate cognitive deficits, physical disabilities, and
              other symptoms of neurodegeneration. Terminology and definitions
              for imaging the features of SVD vary widely, which is also true
              for protocols for image acquisition and image analysis. This lack
              of consistency hampers progress in identifying the contribution
              of SVD to the pathophysiology and clinical features of common
              neurodegenerative diseases. We are an international working group
              from the Centres of Excellence in Neurodegeneration. We completed
              a structured process to develop definitions and imaging standards
              for markers and consequences of SVD. We aimed to achieve the
              following: first, to provide a common advisory about terms and
              definitions for features visible on MRI; second, to suggest
              minimum standards for image acquisition and analysis; third, to
              agree on standards for scientific reporting of changes related to
              SVD on neuroimaging; and fourth, to review emerging imaging
              methods for detection and quantification of preclinical
              manifestations of SVD. Our findings and recommendations apply to
              research studies, and can be used in the clinical setting to

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a highly
              prevalent condition associated with diffuse ischemic damage and
              cognitive dysfunction particularly in executive function and
              attention. Functional brain imaging studies can reveal mechanisms
              of cognitive impairment in CSVD, although findings are mixed.
              METHODS: A systematic review integrating findings from functional
              magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography in CSVD is
              involved. RESULTS: CSVD damages long-range white matter tracts
              connecting nodes within distributed brain networks. It also
              disrupts frontosubcortical circuits and cholinergic fiber tracts
              mediating attentional processes. These changes, illustrated
              within a model of network dynamics, synergistically relate to
              neurodegenerative pathology contributing to dementia. DISCUSSION:
              The effects of CSVD on attention and executive functioning are
              best understood within a network model of cognition as revealed
              by functional neuroimaging. Analysis of network function in CSVD
              can improve characterization of disease severity and treatment
              effects, and it can inform theoretical models of brain function.",

  abstract = "Connectivity analyses and computational modeling of human brain
              function from fMRI data frequently require the specification of
              regions of interests (ROIs). Several analyses have relied on
              atlases derived from anatomical or cyto-architectonic boundaries
              to specify these ROIs, yet the suitability of atlases for resting
              state functional connectivity (FC) studies has yet to be
              established. This article introduces a data-driven method for
              generating an ROI atlas by parcellating whole brain resting-state
              fMRI data into spatially coherent regions of homogeneous FC.
              Several clustering statistics are used to compare methodological
              trade-offs as well as determine an adequate number of clusters.
              Additionally, we evaluate the suitability of the parcellation
              atlas against four ROI atlases (Talairach and Tournoux,
              Harvard-Oxford, Eickoff-Zilles, and Automatic Anatomical
              Labeling) and a random parcellation approach. The evaluated
              anatomical atlases exhibit poor ROI homogeneity and do not
              accurately reproduce FC patterns present at the voxel scale. In
              general, the proposed functional and random parcellations perform
              equivalently for most of the metrics evaluated. ROI size and
              hence the number of ROIs in a parcellation had the greatest
              impact on their suitability for FC analysis. With 200 or fewer
              ROIs, the resulting parcellations consist of ROIs with anatomic
              homology, and thus offer increased interpretability. Parcellation
              results containing higher numbers of ROIs (600 or 1,000) most
              accurately represent FC patterns present at the voxel scale and
              are preferable when interpretability can be sacrificed for
              accuracy. The resulting atlases and clustering software have been

              for WMH detection, based on the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN)
              algorithm. Relative to previous k-NN based segmentation methods,
              BIANCA offers different options for weighting the spatial
              information, local spatial intensity averaging, and different
              options for the choice of the number and location of the training
              points. BIANCA is multimodal and highly flexible so that the user
              can adapt the tool to their protocol and specific needs. We
              optimised and validated BIANCA on two datasets with different MRI
              protocols and patient populations (a ``predominantly

              segmented WMH mask. The correlation between the volumes extracted

              reproducibility test, to evaluate the robustness of BIANCA, and

              Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI)
              offers the possibility of in vivo human cortical parcellation.
              Almost all previous parcellations relied on 1 of 2 approaches.
              The local gradient approach detects abrupt transitions in
              functional connectivity patterns. These transitions potentially
              reflect cortical areal boundaries defined by histology or
              visuotopic fMRI. By contrast, the global similarity approach
              clusters similar functional connectivity patterns regardless of
              spatial proximity, resulting in parcels with homogeneous
              (similar) rs-fMRI signals. Here, we propose a gradient-weighted
              Markov Random Field (gwMRF) model integrating local gradient and
              global similarity approaches. Using task-fMRI and rs-fMRI across
              diverse acquisition protocols, we found gwMRF parcellations to be
              more homogeneous than 4 previously published parcellations.
              Furthermore, gwMRF parcellations agreed with the boundaries of
              certain cortical areas defined using histology and visuotopic
              fMRI. Some parcels captured subareal (somatotopic and visuotopic)
              features that likely reflect distinct computational units within
              known cortical areas. These results suggest that gwMRF
              parcellations reveal neurobiologically meaningful features of
              brain organization and are potentially useful for future
              applications requiring dimensionality reduction of voxel-wise

              about the impact of cognitive impairment on brain dynamic
              functional connectivity (DFC) in SIVD patients with MCI. In the
              present study, the DFC analysis method was applied to the resting
              functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of 37 SIVD
              controls (SIVD-Control) without cognitive impairment, 34 SIVD
              patients with amnestic MCI (SIVD-aMCI) and 30 SIVD patients with
              nonamnestic MCI (SIVD-naMCI). The results indicated that the
              cognitive impairment of SIVD mainly reduced the mean dwell time
              of State 3 with overall strong positive connections. The
              reduction degree of SIVD-aMCI was larger than that of SIVD-naMCI.
              The memory/execution function impairment of SIVD also changed the

              diagnosed on the basis of brain imaging biomarkers, including
              recent small subcortical infarcts, white matter hyperintensities,
              lacunes, cerebral microbleeds, enlarged perivascular spaces, and
              cerebral atrophy. Advanced imaging modalities can detect signs of
              disease even earlier than current standard imaging techniques.
              Diffusion tensor imaging can identify altered white matter
              connectivity, and blood oxygenation level-dependent imaging can
              identify decreased vascular reactivity. Pathogenesis is thought
              to begin with an etiologically specific insult, with or without
              genetic predisposition, which results in dysfunction of the
              neurovascular unit. Uncertainties regarding pathogenesis have
              delayed development of effective treatment. The most widely
              accepted approach to treatment is to intensively control
              well-established vascular risk factors, of which hypertension is
              the most important. With better understanding of pathogenesis,
              specific therapies may emerge. Early identification of pathologic
              characteristics with advanced imaging provides an opportunity to
              forestall progression before emergence of symptoms.",

              in cerebral small-vessel disease (SVD) and its relationship with

              cross-sectional design applied graph-based efficiency analysis to
              deterministic diffusion tensor tractography data from 115
              patients with lacunar infarction and leukoaraiosis and 50 healthy
              individuals. Structural connectivity was estimated between 90
              cortical and subcortical brain regions and efficiency measures of
              resulting graphs were analyzed. Networks were compared between
              SVD and control groups, and associations between efficiency
              measures, conventional MRI disease markers, and cognitive
              function were tested. RESULTS: Brain diffusion tensor
              tractography network connectivity was significantly reduced in
              SVD: networks were less dense, connection weights were lower, and
              measures of network efficiency were significantly disrupted. The
              degree of brain network disruption was associated with MRI
              measures of disease severity and cognitive function. In multiple
              regression models controlling for confounding variables,
              associations with cognition were stronger for network measures

              of the DMN was lower in patients with high disease burden

              associated to stroke, dementia and depression. To shed light on
              its opaque pathophysiology, we conducted a neuroimaging study
              aiming to assess the location of CSVD-induced damage in the human
              brain network. Structural connectomes of 930 subjects of the
              Hamburg City Health Study were reconstructed from diffusion
              weighted imaging. The connectome edges were partitioned into
              groups according to specific schemes: (1) connection to grey
              matter regions, (2) course and length of underlying streamlines.
              Peak-width of skeletonised mean diffusivity (PSMD) - a surrogate
              marker for CSVD - was related to each edge group's connectivity
              in a linear regression analysis allowing localisation of
              CSVD-induced effects. PSMD was associated with statistically
              significant decreases in connectivity of most investigated edge
              groups except those involved in connecting limbic, insular,
              temporal or cerebellar regions. Connectivity of interhemispheric

              subcortical and frontal brain regions decreased most severely
              with increasing PSMD. In conclusion, MRI findings of CSVD are
              associated with widespread impairment of structural brain network
              connectivity, which supports the understanding of CSVD as a
              global brain disease. The pattern of regional preference might

              several important risk and prognostic factors in major chronic
              diseases. A random sample of 45,000 participants between 45 and

              novel examinations primarily targeting major organ system
              function and structures including extensive imaging examinations.
              The protocol includes validate self-reports via questionnaires
              regarding lifestyle and environmental conditions, dietary habits,
              physical condition and activity, sexual dysfunction, professional

              classical risk factors for major chronic diseases and
              survivorship, the core intention is to gather valid prevalence

              suggests that certain areas form local hierarchical relations

              particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of
              large-scale circuits without clear hierarchical relations. In
              this study the organization of networks in the human cerebrum was
              explored using resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Data
              from 1,000 subjects were registered using surface-based
              alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify and
              replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the
              cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to
              sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of
              association regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices,
              functional connectivity followed topographic representations
              across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity
              patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network
              boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand
              properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor
              pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal
              area complex (MT+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye
              field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within
              and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the
              MT+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with
              a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional
              connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was

              largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by
              discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral
              networks in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential
              evolutionary expansion in humans to support cognition.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether longitudinal structural
              network efficiency is associated with cognitive decline and
              whether baseline network efficiency predicts mortality in
              cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). METHODS: A prospective,
              single-centre cohort consisting of 277 non-demented individuals
              with SVD was conducted. In 2011 and 2015, all participants were
              scanned with MRI and underwent neuropsychological assessment. We
              computed network properties using graph theory from probabilistic
              tractography and calculated changes in psychomotor speed and
              overall cognitive index. Multiple linear regressions were
              performed, while adjusting for potential confounders. We divided
              the group into mild-to-moderate white matter hyperintensities
              (WMH) and severe WMH group based on median split on WMH volume.
              RESULTS: The decline in global efficiency was significantly
              associated with a decline in psychomotor speed in the group with
              severe WMH ($\beta$=0.18, p=0.03) and a trend with change in
              cognitive index ($\beta$=0.14, p=0.068), which diminished after
              adjusting for imaging markers for SVD. Baseline global efficiency
              was associated with all-cause mortality (HR per decrease of 1 SD
              0.43, 95\% CI 0.23 to 0.80, p=0.008, C-statistic 0.76).
              CONCLUSION: Disruption of the network efficiency, a metric
              assessing the efficiency of network information transfer, plays
              an important role in explaining cognitive decline in SVD, which
              was however not independent of imaging markers of SVD.
              Furthermore, baseline network efficiency predicts risk of
              mortality in SVD that may reflect the global health status of the
              brain in SVD. This emphasises the importance of structural
              network analysis in the context of SVD research and the use of
              network measures as surrogate markers in research setting.",

              state fMRI were used to create connectivity matrices from 26
              subjects with symptomatic MRI confirmed lacunar stroke and 19
              controls. Matrices were constructed at multiple scales based on a
              multi-resolution cortical atlas and at multiple thresholds for
              the matrix density. Network parameters were calculated over the
              multiple resolutions and thresholds. In addition the
              reproducibility of structural and functional network parameters
              was determined in a subset of the subjects (15 SVD, 10 controls)
              who were scanned twice. Results: Structural networks showed a
              highly significant loss of network integrity in SVD cases
              compared to controls, for all network measures. In contrast
              functional networks showed no difference between SVD and

              both cases and controls, with ICC values consistently over 0.8.
              In contrast functional network measures showed much poorer
              reproducibility with ICC values in the range 0.4-0.6 overall, and
              even lower in SVD cases. Conclusions: Structural networks
              identify impaired network integrity, and are highly reproducible,
              in SVD, supporting their use as markers of SVD disease severity.
              In contrast, functional networks showed low reproducibility,
              particularly in SVD cases, and were unable to detect differences
              between SVD cases and controls with this sample size.",
