\section{Results}
For this replication study, a total of \num{2648} datasets were available, of which \num{970} were already included in our previous analysis and thus discarded. In \num{13} of the resulting \num{1678} datasets, one or more MRI sequences were missing. Of the complete datasets (n=\num{1665}), we excluded \num{5} participants due to intra-axial space-occupying lesions. An additional \num{9} participants were excluded because of unsuccessful preprocessing, WMH segmentation, or xcpEngine failure, resulting in \num{1651} datasets for analysis. A study-flowchart is provided in \Cref{fig:flowchart}.

Baseline demographic and cognitive values, including the number of missing items, are reported in \Cref{tab:democog}.

WMH volumes (median \qty{1.05}{\milli\litre}, IQR \qtyrange{0.47}{2.37}{\milli\litre}), motion estimates, and fractional occupancies of brain states 1 through 5 are reported in \Cref{tab:fracocc}. 
\input{src/tables/table_fracocc.tex}

In an outcome-neutral quality check of the implementation of (i) the MRI processing pipeline, (ii) brain state estimation, and (iii) co-activation pattern analysis, the mean difference in fractional occupancy between high- and low-occupancy states was consistently maintained, with a point-estimate of the separation between two high-occupancy and three low-occupancy states of \qty{6.7}{\percent} (\qty{95}{\percent} confidence interval, \qtyrange{6.2}{7.1}{\percent}) in the \emph{36p} paradigm. 
This indicates that the implementation of the pipeline was correct and that the brain state estimation and co-activation pattern analysis worked as intended. 


\subsection{Pre-registered hypotheses}
\subsubsection{Association between WMH load and fractional occupancy}
The results of the test of our primary preregistered hypothesis of an association between supratentorial WMH volume and the time spent in high-occupancy brain states are shown in \Cref{fig:hyp1} and \Cref{tab:hyp1}.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{./../analysis/derivatives/Figures/Fig_hyp1.png}
    \mycaption{Association between time spent in high-occupancy brain states and supratentorial WMH volume}{Point estimates (black line) and 95\%-confidence region (light blue ribbon) of the conditional mean fractional occupancy are obtained from unadjusted beta regression modelling. Each marker represents one of N=1642 independent participants with a non-zero total WMH volume. }
    \label{fig:hyp1}
\end{figure}

\input{src/tables/table_hyp1.tex}

Adjusted for age and sex, there was a \num{0.94}-fold reduction in the odds of occupying a high-occupancy brain state for every \num{5.1}-fold increase in WMH load (P \num{5.01e-8}).

\subsubsection{Association between executive function and fractional occupancy in DMN-related states}

The results of the test of our secondary preregistered hypothesis of an association between time spent in high-occupancy brain states and executive function as measured by the complete part B of the TMT are shown in \Cref{fig:hyp2} and \Cref{tab:hyp2}.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{./../analysis/derivatives/Figures/Fig_hyp2.png}
    \mycaption{Association between time spent in high-occupancy DMN-related brain states and TMT-B completion time}{Point estimates (black line) and 95\%-confidence region (light blue ribbon) of the conditional mean TMT-B completion time are obtained from unadjusted Gamma regression modelling. Each marker represent one of N=1482 independent participants with non-zero total WMH volume and available TMT-B data.}
    \label{fig:hyp2}
\end{figure}

\input{src/tables/table_hyp2.tex}

Adjusted for age, sex, WMH volume, and years of education, there was a \num{0.98}-fold reduction in the time to complete the TMT-B for every \qty{5}{\percent} increase in the time spent in high-occupancy brain states (P \num{0.0116}).


\subsection{Multiverse analysis}

In a multiverse analysis, the main findings of associations between WMH load and FO and, to a lesser extent, between FO and TMT-B were robust with respect to the processing choices of brain parcellation and confound regression strategy.

A nominally statistically significant negative association between the total WMH load and time spent in high-occupancy states was observed in 48/81 scenarios, with 8/81 significant positive associations occurring with the Desikan--Killiany parcellation only (\Cref{fig:mv}{A}). 
For periventricular (deep) WMH volume, the results were similarly robust with 49/81 (39/81) negative and 8/81 (0/81) positive associations of nominal statistical significance, respectively.

The secondary finding of an association between greater TMT-B times and lower fractional occupancy was less robust with only 16/81 nominally statistically significant negative and no significant positive associations, irrespective of operationalization of cSVD (total vs. periventricular vs. deep WMH volume) (\Cref{fig:mv}{B}).

    \mycaption{Multiverse analysis}{Adjusted effect size estimates of the associations between cSVD severity (WMH volume) and network dedifferentiation (less time spent in high-occupancy DMN-related brain states) [\textbf{A)}], and between network dedifferentiation and executive function (TMT-B completion time) [\textbf{B)}]. Effect sizes are given per 5.1-fold increase in WMH volume and a 5\%-increase in fractional occupancy, respectively. Markers and line segments indicate point estimates and 95\%-confidence intervals for adjusted odds ratios for different combinations of confound regression strategy and brain parcellation. The primary analytical choices are indicated by dark blue circles (\emph{}36p) and light blue shading (Schaefer-400). Model equations for beta and gamma regressions, respectively, are given at the top. Vertical lines indicate no effect (black) and the effect size observed in the discovery cohort \citep{Schlemm2022-he} (light blue), respectively, for reference. Effect sizes not reaching nominal statistical significance ($\alpha=0.05$) are shown desaturated. Corresponding data based on periventricular and deep WMH volumes are presented in the Supplementary Appendix.}

\subsection{Additional analyses}
\subsubsection{Connectivity profiles of brain states -- relation to default mode network}
Based on the cosine similarity between positive and negative activations of cluster centroids and indicator vectors of pre-defined large scale brain networks, network activation profiles were computed for brain states estimated from Schaefer parcellations of varying spatial resolutions.

\Cref{fig:spider} shows the corresponding spider plots, identifying states characterized by activation (DMN+) or suppression (DMN-) of the default mode network as states with the highest fractional occupancy.

    States are ordered by mean fractional occupancy across N=1651 independent participants, indicated by parenthetical percentages. Two high-occupancy states are characterized by activation or suppression of the DMN, the remaining three low-occupancy states (S3--5) were not used in the present study. Note that mean FO values are similar, but not identical, to median FO values reported in \Cref{tab:fracocc}.}

\subsubsection{Association with other cognitive domains}
Associations between the time spent in high-occupancy DMN-related brain states and cognitive measures beyond TMT-B are shown in \Cref{fig:FOvsCOG}.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./../analysis/derivatives/Figures/Fig_FOvsCOG.png}
    \mycaption{Association between time spent in high-occupancy DMN-related brain states and cognitive measures}{Point estimates (black line) and 95\%-confidence region (light blue ribbon) of the conditional mean cognitive measures are obtained from unadjusted binomial (top row: Mini-Mental State Examination, Vocabulary, Word List Recall, logit link) and Gamma regression (bottom row: Animal Naming, Trail Making Test [TMT] A/B: log link) modelling. 
    
    Each marker represents one of N independent participants, as indicated. Insets report effect sizes and P-values both with (adjusted [a-]) and without adjustment for the nuisance variables age, sex, WMH volume (coded as in \Cref{fig:mv}), and years of education. Effect sizes were quantified as odds ratios (ORs) (top) or response scale multipliers [exp(b)] (bottom), and correspond to a 20\%-increase in fractional occupancy. Note the different reference change in FO compared to \Cref{tab:hyp2} chosen to adequately represent some of the smaller effect sizes. The bottom right panel highlighted in dark blue reproduces \Cref{fig:hyp2}.}

\end{figure}


Adjusted for age, sex, WMH load, and years of education, FO in DMN-related states appeared to be associated with better word recall (adjusted OR 1.19, nominal P 0.013), but not with global cognitive functioning (MMSE, adjusted OR 1.09) or vocabulary (aOR 1.09), nor with verbal fluency (animal naming, adjusted $\exp(\beta)$ 1.04), or pure processing speed (TMT-A, adjusted $\exp(\beta)$ 0.97).
