\subsection{Timeline and access to data}
At the time of planning of this study, all demographic, clinical and imaging data used in this analysis had been collected by the HCHS and were held in the central trial database.
Quality checks for non-imaging variables had been performed centrally.
WMH segmentation based on structural MRI data of the first \num{10000} participants of the HCHS had been performed previously using the BIANCA/LOCATE approach \citep{Rimmele2022-bz}.
Functional MRI data and clinical measures of executive dysfunction (TMT-B scores) had not previously been analyzed by the pre-registering author (ES).
