\subsection{Timeline and access to data}
At the time of planning of this study, all demographic, clinical and imaging data used in this analysis have been collected by the HCHS and are held in the central trial database.
Quality checks for non-imaging variables have been performed centrally.
WMH segmentation based on structural MRI data of the first \num{10000} participants of the HCHS has been performed previously using the BIANCA/LOCATE approach \citep{Rimmele2022-bz} and results are included in this preregistration ($\texttt{./derivaties/WMH/cSVD\_all.csv}$).
Functional MRI data and clinical measures of executive dysfunction (TMT-B scores) have not been analyzed by the author.
Analysis of the data will begin immediately after acceptance-in-principle of the stage 1 submission of the registered report is obtained. Submission of the full manuscript (stage 2) is planned two months later.
